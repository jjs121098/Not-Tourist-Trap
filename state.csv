"7","2","Paris","The Champs-Elysees is a truly lovely avenue: a picture postcard scene. Nearly 2 kilometres in length, this historic thoroughfare runs from Place de la Concorde to the majestic Arc de Triomphe. But though it has since become the world's most beautiful avenue, the Champs-Elysees was once a swamp. The avenue has only become more beautiful with every passing decade.","Set in the heart of Paris, the former French royal palace today is home to one of the largest and most renowned art collections in the world.

"10","7","Flores","These paradise islands with gorgeous scenery, pretty pink sand beaches and crystal clear waters form part of Flores, which is just an hour’s flight from Bali. While every inch of Bali’s popular beaches is often crowded with tourists, these relatively untouched tropical islands guarantee you more privacy with ravishing lagoons and even greater outdoors and sceneries.","Sand is sand, right? Wrong. From black and green to orange and pink hues, coastlines of the world offer an array of colorful sand options. Remember, as you check off your rainbow-beach bucket list, please take only photographs, not sand. While tempting, removing sand from the beach dilutes the color and ruins the experience for future generations.","komodo_dragons.jpg","pink_beach.jpg","labuan_bajo.jpg","Komodo Island","Tangsi Beach (Pink Beach)","white"
"12","6","New York City","Times Square is one of New York City's most popular tourist attractions, as it's the epicenter for all things media and a famous New Year's Eve venue. A stroll through the area—with its bright lights and skyscrapers plastered with digital billboards—is pretty impressive. And as you walk the streets looking up and taking on the ambiance, you don't have to worry about stepping in the way of an oncoming cab. New York City reduced the amount of vehicle traffic through the Times Square area, making it a more pleasant place to linger and people watch. While here, catch a Broadway show, hang out in Bryant Park, or book a luxury suite at a historical city hotel.","Located on the 12-acre Liberty Island in New York Harbor, The Statue of Liberty was dedicated on October 28, 1886 and was designated a National Monument on October 15, 1924.

"14","8","Seoul","Gyeongbokgung Palace arguably the most beautiful and remains the grandest of all five palaces is also called “Northern Palace” because it is the furthest north when compared to the neighbouring palaces of Changdeokgung (Eastern Palace) and Gyeongheegung (Western Palace).","Situated between by two palaces, Gyeongbokgung to the west and Changdeokgung to the east, this village has the largest cluster of privately owned traditional Korean wooden homes or hanok in Seoul.

The Bukchon area is a traditional residential area in Seoul that boasts 600 years of history. Its location reflects the views of neo-Confucianism, regarding the world and nature, during the Joseon Dynasty.

Hanok architecture places great emphasis on the topographical features of the land on which it is built. Structural arrangements, layouts, and other spatial aesthetics are major concerns here, as are the styles of the buildings themselves.","seoul.jpeg","bukchon_hanok.jpg","6249.jpg","Gyeongbokgung Palace","Bukchon Hanok Village","white"
